1. **Identify Issue**: Check error logs and user reports
2. **Assess Impact**: Is issue critical (blocks core function)?
3. **Rollback Decision**:
   - **Critical**: Rollback to previous build immediately
   - **Non-critical**: Hotfix and redeploy
4. **Communication**: Notify users of any outages
5. **Root Cause**: Post-incident review to prevent recurrence
